  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements well, including backend Motoko actor with all data types and CRUD operations, frontend pages for all five sections, admin panel with PIN-based access, navigation, and component structure. However, a few requirements have gaps or cannot be fully confirmed from the available diff.",
